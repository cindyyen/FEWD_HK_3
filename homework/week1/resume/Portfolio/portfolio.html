				<p class="des">The UP Program is a food security solution that provides slum communities direct access to nutritious food through a food card system. My team and I built this business model for Hult Prize 2013. The global food crisis was the theme of Hult Prize 2013 and the challenge was to provide food security to the 200 million people living in urban slum conditions. The UP Program made it to the Asia regional final and finished among the global top 10. This is a video I created for our online campaign using Keynote and Final Cut Pro X.</p>

				<p class="des">Live the Impact is the through line that followed the 17 Young Entrepreneurs of the Future 2012 finalists to their visits to entrepreneurial hubs, accelerators and labs in Boston, Toronto, and Waterloo. Young Entrepreneurs of the Future is the leading entrepreneurship incubator organized by Epoch Foundation in Taipei. The annual program admits around 200 people and selects 17 finalists through rounds of team building, business forming, prototyping, and pitching to venture capitalists. This is a video I created for our final exhibition that illustrated our journey to various hubs of innovation and our pitch at MIT Sloan School. The video was created using Motion 5 and Final Cut Pro X.</p>
