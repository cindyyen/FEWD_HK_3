					<p class="des">The UP Program is a food security solution that provides slum communities direct access to nutritious food through a food card system. My team and I built this business model for Hult Prize 2013. The global food crisis was the theme of Hult Prize 2013 and the challenge was to provide food security to the 200 million people living in urban slum conditions. The UP Program made it to the Asia regional final and finished among the global top 10. This is a video I created for our online campaign using Keynote and Final Cut Pro X.</p>

					<p class="des">Live the Impact is the through line that followed the 17 Young Entrepreneurs of the Future 2012 finalists to their visits to entrepreneurial hubs, accelerators and labs in Boston, Toronto, and Waterloo. Young Entrepreneurs of the Future is the leading entrepreneurship incubator organized by Epoch Foundation in Taipei. The annual program admits around 200 people and selects 17 finalists through rounds of team building, business forming, prototyping, and pitching to venture capitalists. This is a video I created for our final exhibition that illustrated our journey to various hubs of innovation and our pitches at MIT Sloan School. The video was created using Motion 5 and Final Cut Pro X.</p>

					<p class="des"><a class="projectlink" href="http://www.hultprize.org/" target="_blank">hultprize.org</a></p>
					<p class="des">GET (Globally Empowered Technology) is a three-tiered funding solution my team and I designed for Hult Global Case Challenge 2012 (now renamed Hult Prize). We competed for the education track to solve poverty-realted education challenges. We worked with One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) and built the GET funding model to help OLPC reach 10 million children in 5 years. GET is a quantitative approach to a qualitative solution. We were the Asia regional runner-up and finished among the global top 10. We also shared GET at the TEDxTaipei 2012 Rising Stars event. Both videos are created with Keynote and Final Cut Pro X.</p>

					<p class="des">A video I created for Epoch Foundation to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Young Entrepreneurs of the Future (YEF). YEF is the leading entrepreneurship incubator in Taipei. Since it's inception, YEF has cultivated more than 20 successful startups, and created a strong entrepreneur network in Taipei and around the world, partnering with MIT Media Lab, Berkeley, and other leading labs and incubators. The video served as a documentary for the first 9 years of YEF, and as a promotional call for future applicants. The video was created with Motion 5 and Final Cut Pro X.</p>
